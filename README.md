The name SprogGo is derived from two words, ‘sprog’, the Danish for language, and ‘go’ in English, emphasising the idea that you are actively going about and learning languages through the app.

The app prompts the user with a word in the language they are learning. Then it uses the Microsoft Computer Vision API to identify objects in photos taken with the camera. The user gains points for taking a photo of the correct object.

Created at Copenhacks 2018 in Copenhagen.
